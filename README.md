## 👋 Hello Cosmos!

I'm Joy, a Software/Web Developer based in London, UK.

### ✨ About Me:
It all began when I was 5 years old and was exposed to [Lego](https://www.lego.com) and [Mechanix](https://zephyrtoys.com/product/plastic-mechanix-planes-161).  
By 10, I began assembling and upgrading PCs.  
Now, I aspire to build the **next iteration of software** ✨
